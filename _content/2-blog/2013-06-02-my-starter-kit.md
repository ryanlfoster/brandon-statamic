title: My Starter Kit
---
<p>I've started a lot of web projects over the years and thus, I've wasted a lot of time going back to previous projects trying to find that one snippet of code that I needed. So I finally decided to create a project to keep track of folders and files that I use as a starting point for each of my websites. It consists of things I've learned over the years or picked up from other frameworks such as&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, and Andy Clarke's&nbsp;<a href="http://malarkey.github.io/Rock-Hammer/">Rock Hammer</a>. My kit isn't anywhere near as comprehensive as Bootstrap or Rock Hammer and it's not supposed to be. I often feel too constrained when I use one of these frameworks so I've only added the basics of what <em>I</em> need to start a website.</p><p>You can visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://bewoldt.github.io/_starter_files/">styleguide document</a> or view the project on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bewoldt/_starter_files">GitHub</a>.</p>
