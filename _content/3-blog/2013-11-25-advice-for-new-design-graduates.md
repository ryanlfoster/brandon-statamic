title: Advice for New Design Graduates
---
<p>With the end of semester coming up shortly I thought I'd put together some words of wisdom for recent or upcoming graduates in the Design industry. Some of these are from personal experience and some are just good common sense.</p><h2>Show Your Work</h2><p>No excuses, get an online portfolio. This is 2013, if you’re a designer worth your mettle, you better have an online portfolio. It's not as hard as you may think. Hopefully you took some HTML courses during your education but if you didn't you can use services like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://cargocollective.com/">Cargo</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/">Tumblr</a>. You can have a site up and running in a couple of hours. Please, have some self-respect and don't use GoDaddy or Wix. Or, you could learn some HTML/CSS on your own and create a site that truly fits your personality. It's funner than you think. One of the best portfolio sites I know of isn't by a web designer, it's by a letterer who learned HTML on her own.&nbsp;<a href="http://jessicahische.is/">Check it out</a>.</p><p>Ok, now that you have a portfolio please don't fill it up with everything you've ever done since high school. Focus. Your portfolio is not what you did, but what you want to do next. Don't be afraid to cut out projects.</p><p>Show projects that relate to the real world. It's ok to show your creative side with a personal project but don't fill up your entire portfolio with these. I have real clients with real problems. I need to know that you have ideas and can solve problems under real constraints and deadlines.</p><p>I want to see the entire process, not just the finished product. What was the brief? What problems were you trying to solve? Show me your sketches, show me your iterations. I want to see the evolution.</p><h2>Applying For The Right Job</h2><p>Don’t wait around for job listings. Just because a company doesn't have any open positions doesn't mean they aren't looking for talent. If you already know who you want to work for send an email directly to the art director or manager. If you've done your research you should already know who they are and what their email is.</p><p>Never add designs as attachments in an email. I won't look at them. That's what your online portfolio is for remember?</p><p>Your resume should never exceed 1 page. No Word docs, ever!</p><p>Don't go crazy trying to brand your resume. Keep it straightforward. Take that effort and use it on your website.</p><p>Sorry, but there's a good chance I'll never read your cover letter. The first thing I'm going to do is Google you and read your Twitter account. If your Twitter account is locked, your doing it wrong.</p><p>There's more than one way to apply for a job. Do you want this job more than anyone else? Prove it. Here are four creative examples of people applying for their dream jobs.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.florianisallin.com">http://www.florianisallin.com</a></li><li><a href="http://www.florianisallin.com"></a><a href="http://googlepleasehire.me">http://googlepleasehire.me</a></li><li><a href="http://googlepleasehire.me"></a><a href="http://jasonzimdars.com/svn/">http://jasonzimdars.com/svn/</a></li><li><a href="http://jasonzimdars.com/svn/"></a><a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/advertising-student-ships-his-pants-kmarts-agency-lands-internship-149683">http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/advertising-student-...</a></li></ul><h2>Ace The Interview</h2><p>Dress up. Even if the company you're applying to praises how laid back their culture is and their website is filled with photos of employees wearing flip flops you still need to dress up.</p><p>Do your research ahead of time. Read their website. Read their blog posts. Follow them on Twitter.</p><p>Never under any circumstances talk bad about a former employer or employee.</p><p>Keep it together. Throughout most of the interview I'm wondering if I'm going to go crazy sitting next to this person for 8 hours a day.</p><p>Talk with confidence. Don't make excuses. Remember, I'm not hiring your designs, I'm hiring you. I don't care if you designed Facebook's logo, if you come off as mean or arrogant no one will want to work with you.</p><p>Don’t forget that the interview process goes both ways. When the time comes, have 3 questions ready to ask. On the way out ask to see where you would sit if hired. Look at the office, the chair, the desk. The quality of the office equipment shows how much a company values their employees. Believe me, it's true.</p><h2>Giving The Presentation</h2><p>Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. You should know your presentation backwards and forwards. If should feel effortless and natural.</p><p>I do not want to see your presentation on your iPad.</p><p>No more than 10-12 projects.</p><p>Think about how to sequence you projects so that there is a beginning a middle and an end. Your presentation should tell a story. Don’t just show me your work, describe the client, describe the brief, talk about what problems you were trying to solve.</p><p>Don't rush it. Leave time for people to ask questions.</p><p>Send a thank you email to everyone who participated in the interview. If you want to be creative send a handwritten card.</p><h2>Getting The Job</h2><p>Did you get the job? Great! Before you accept, here are a few pointers.</p><p>Ask about vacation and sick leave. If they don't offer vacation time until you've worked there for a year run away. Run away fast.</p><p>Ask what restrictions they have on freelancing.</p><p>Don't ever work for a company that makes you sign a non-compete agreement meaning they can forbid you from working at a competing company in the area if you leave. I know you're eager to start but you have to think about your future first.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
