title: Web Designer Tool Belt
---
<p>Every web designer has his or her set of tools they wear on their tool belt. Here are some of my favorites I use on a daily basis.</p><h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></h3><p>My go-to text editor. I've tried a few text editors and the speed and simplicity of sublime text sets it apart from the others.</p><h3><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a></h3><p>Using Sass(Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) has completely changed how I write my CSS. Of course, I'm terrible at using the command line so Codekit comes to the rescue. In addition to compiling and minifying my css and javascript files it also reloads the browser every time you save a file.</p><h3><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a></h3><p>I know it's not really a piece of software but I think it deserves a place here.</p><h3><a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a></h3><p>I go back and forth with Tower. Sometimes I like it sometimes I hate it, but currently it's my Git client of choice.</p><h3><a href="http://littleipsum.com/">LittleIpsum</a></h3><p>Want to generate some latin text? Want three words, a sentence, or a paragraph? LittleIpsum is just what you need. I can't tell you how much time I've saved using this app. </p><h3><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></h3><p>I save everything to Dropbox. After using the free version for the last 3 years I finally had to upgrade to the paid version but it's well worth the money.</p><h3><a href="http://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack</a></h3><p>Every once in awhile I need to browser test across a bunch of older browsers like ie8 or 9. BrowserStack is this best tool for the job. The best part is you can test your local files too. </p><h3><a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">GhostLab</a></h3><p>My newest addition of my set of tools. I use this to browser test across multiple devices. I currently use it to connection my desktop, mobile phone, and tablet together so test out my media queries.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></h3><p>Great for collaborating with coworkers or for just keeping files consistent across home and work.</p><h3><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a></h3><p>Most of my day consists of either looking at Photoshop or SublimeText. I know everyone wants to design in the browser nowadays but I've got at least 10,000 hours invested in this program so I'm sticking with it.</p><h3><a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a></h3><p>My new favorite content management system for people who hate databases. I'm still a beginner but so far I'm loving it. </p><h3><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a></h3><p>For when sticky notes don't cut it anymore. Trello comes in handy to organize all of my to-dos so I stay on task.</p>
